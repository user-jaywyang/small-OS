# Small OS
## What is this?
Ignis is an open source hobby OS meant to gain experience with low level concepts and implementations. Note that this is not a Linux distribution, but rather a kernel written from scratch

## Technical Description
- It is designed for 64 bit systems for the x86 instruction set
- It uses a custom Multiboot2 compatible boot header with GRUB2
- For testing and developing, it is emulated using [QEMU](https://qemu.org)

## Installation
### Required Build Dependencies
- A modern C compiler(GNU gcc recommended)
- A linker (GNU ld recommended)
- An assembler (NASM recommended)
- grub-mkrescue
- make

### Required Emulator
- You must install the QEMU emulator to for this project.
- It is expected by `make run` to emulate the ignis.iso image created by `make`

### Getting Started
**Steps**:
- Install build dependencies.
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/user-jaywyang/small-OS && cd small-OS`
- Compile and package the project with `make` or `make all`
  - The `Makefile` creates a ignis.iso file in iso/boot/ that is emulated by QEMU
- Run the QEMU emulator with `make run` or `make run_debug`
